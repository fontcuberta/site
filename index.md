## Hi, I’m Javi. I’m a software engineer who travels around the world.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always had a love for coding. I strive to design simple, clean, and beautiful products with the hope that they make a difference in the world. Currently I’m leading the UX & UI design over at MediaSmart.

I’m always up for a new challenge. I'm available for freelance work, so if you think I could help, please reach out to me at <a href='mailto:javi.jimenez.villar@gmail.com'>javi.jimenez.villar@gmail.com</a>.
